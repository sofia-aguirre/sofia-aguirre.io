## Introduction
My goal was to make a really clever site that smooth scrolled through each section, each section taking up 94% of the 
user's screen height. Did not finish some elements, but will continue to work on it.

##Technologies used.
- Bootstrap+Cloudfare for the image and text carousels
- Google fonts
- JQuery and Vanilla JS
- SmoothScroll Polyfill JS

##Your process/approach.
I began by doing the design whiteboard, then structured the DOM, then focused on getting all the content in and
getting the layout appropriate for responsiveness section by section. After I got through each section, I would apply a JS function
if it was required.

###Problems with this approach:
Spent too much time on design
Too much time on layout, making sure things were responsive and the appropriate size (however, doing this section by section instead of all at once made it much harder and had things fighting each other all the time).
Should have planned out my time for JS better and made use of our instructors in class.
Also should have pseudocoded more, as that would have made it easier to visualize and find the right 
functions needed for each problem's smaller problems.

##Unsolved problems.
Nav bar can't smooth scroll anymore... I don't know what I did to break it!
Didn't have time to add the underline to the active nav bar links
Responsiveness took a nose dive towards the end of the project

##Biggest wins and challenges.
My biggest win was able to get the carousel and modals up. I was surprised at how easy it was
to structure despite how intimidating it looked in the Bootstrap docs. 
Major div hell.... tried to be as semantic as possible, but could be better cleaned up.
My biggest challenges were organizing my work flow in the proper order. I learned not to do tackle a project's page
section by section, and rather do all of HTML, CSS, and JS at once in that order. There are probably
much better ways to approach it, which I will definitely take a look into.
